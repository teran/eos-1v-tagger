EOS 1V Tagger
=============

Intro
-----

Here's Golang library and CLI binary to parse CSV's from Canon ES-E1 software to allow EXIF tagging film scans according to metadata from such CSV's.

Development status: Just started

Usage
-----

```shell
tagger CSV_FILE
```

At the momment it suppose you have the following format film scan files: `FILM_%5f.dng`, for example: `FILM_00001.dng` so exiftool commands are generated based on that file naming scheme.

NOTICES
-------

* It's in **deep alpha** state
* It's **NOT** going to make any changes to real data: just prints exiftool commands to STDOUT
* It relies on the data provided by ES-E1 software in CSV format(in EOS 1V Memory just export via `File` -> `Export` -> `CSV`)
* It does **NOT** perform timezone detection since ES-E1 exports timestamps without timezone mark.
* **Always** carefully review exiftool commands *before* applying them.
